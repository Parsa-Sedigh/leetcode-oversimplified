The actual number of a node doesn't matter.

This problem is a graph problem.

We don't know any subtree actually has an apple in it or not until we fully traverse it, so we're gonna traverse the entire graph.

Note: The most number of neighbor nodes any single node can have is 3(one parent, two children).
