# DFS
# T: O(r * c)
# M: O(r * c)
# The memory complexity is because of the visit hashset which in worst case of all cells being lands, is r * c land cells.
# So the visit hashset could have up to r * c els.
# The recursive callstack also contributes to the memory complexity. Since you're using DFS, the recursive stack depth
# could go up to the size of the largest connected component of land cells. In the worst case (if all cells are connected land cells),
# the stack depth could be O(mÃ—n). So (r * c) + (r * c) => O(r * c)
