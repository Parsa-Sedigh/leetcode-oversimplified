# if so, add the root of one of same subtrees to `res`.

# 3. Depth First Search (Optimal) - serialization using node vals
# CORE IDEA: To identify duplicate subtrees, we need a way to uniquely represent each subtree (its structure and values) and
# check if weâ€™ve seen it before.

# Serialization: Convert each subtree into a unique tuple (value, left_subtree, right_subtree) based on its root value and
# serialized forms of its left and right subtrees.

# Counting: Use a dictionary to count how many times each serialized subtree appears. When a subtree appears for the second time,
# add its root to the `res` var.

# T: O(n)
# M: O(n)
# Recursion Stack: O(H)
# Dictionary (count): O(n)

            left_serialized = dfs(node.left)
            right_serialized = dfs(node.right)

            # Create a unique tuple for the current subtree
            cur = ((node.val, left_serialized, right_serialized))

            # If we've seen this subtree exactly once before (count == 1), it's the second occurrence, Add the current node to
            # the result as the root of a duplicate subtree
            if count[cur] == 1:
                res.append(node)
