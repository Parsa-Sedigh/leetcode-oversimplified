# 1. Brute Force
# T: O(n^2)
# Why?
# - At each node, maxHeight(root) is called, which itself runs in O(n).
# - Since diameterOfBinaryTree(root) is called O(n) times overall (once per node), and each call involves an O(n) traversal
#   due to maxHeight(root), the final complexity is O(nÂ²). So we call this func n times and each call involves a O(n) operation.
#   So overall: O(n^2)

# M: O(h) - since the max size of call stack is O(log(n)) in a balanced tree and O(n) in a skewed tree
