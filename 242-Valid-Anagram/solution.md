Follow up: What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?

A: The fixed-size array approach uses an array of 26 elements, relying on `ord(char) - ord('a')` to map lowercase letters to
indices 0â€“25. This won't work for Unicode, as there are potentially millions of unique characters (Unicode supports over 1.1 million code points).
Instead, use the hashmap approach.
