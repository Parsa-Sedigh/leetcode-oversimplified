If we take a number and mod it by 10, you get the ones place value. For example if we mod 19 by 10, we get 9(ones place value).

If we divide a number by 10, we get tens place value. For example 19 / 10 = 1

Note: This is not the most efficient solution. There's a better way to do this and the better way to do this is like the problem `linked list cycle`.
Because this problem is a linked list problem at it's heart.
